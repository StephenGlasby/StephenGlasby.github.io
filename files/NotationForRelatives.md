It is very clear that a lot of children and even adults struggle with
the nomenclature for relatives, and understanding where relatives fit onto
the family tree. What do I call my cousin's daughter? How am I related to
my father's cousin? A helpful way is to view your relatives as located at the
vertices of a binary tree, and use the mathematical fact that there is a
unique path from any one vertex on the tree to another. Then you just need to
describe how many steps from you *up* to a common ancestor, and then *down* to
your relative. For example, with this naming scheme your cousin is called
2-up-2-down because you must go up two steps (parent, then grandparent)
to a common andcestor, and two steps down (to aunt or uncle), and then to
their child (your first cousin).

Here is a small dictionary: a sibling is 1-up-1-down, a parent is 1-up,
a son/daughter is 1-down, a grandson/daughter is 2-down and a
grandmother/father is 2-up. A second cousin is 3-up-3-down and a third cousin
is 4-up-4-down. If you go down one more than you go up, then you say "once
removed". Hence your first cousin once removed is 2-up-3-down, and a second
cousin once removed is 3-up-4-down.

Unfortunately, our naming system for relatives also uses "once removed" if
you go up one more than you go down. Hence 3-up-2-down is also called
your second cousin once removed. At this point, I think you can see that our
naming system for relatives is not up to the job, and M-up-N-down (for whole
numbers M,N) is much clearer.

Genealogists know all of this intuitively, but tend not to describe relations
via the position on a binary tree. Hence they take a lot of words to distinguish
between 2-up-3-down and 3-up-2-down. I prefer to use this compact unambiguous
notation to describe complicated relationships. I am not suggesting calling
you sibling 1-up-1-down or your parent 1-up, but cousins and beyond would be
fair game. The notation is gender-neutral, which some may like, but many
genealogist will dislike. It is shorter to say my aunt than my female
2-up-1-down, or my nephew than my male 1-up-2-down. A good compomise
is to use *both* naming systems: choosing the one that is brief, unambiguous
and easy to understand. To help learn the system up-down system here is a
