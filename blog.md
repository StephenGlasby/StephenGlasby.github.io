<h2> Academic publishing</h2>

Mathematicians are good at seeing how to solve problems, but how good
are they at implementing the solutions?

In 2012 Tim Gowers wrote a
[blog](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/elsevier-my-part-in-its-downfall/)  that went viral.
He described how mathematics was being negatively impacted by Elsevier, and
it did not need to be. Mathematicians can set up high quality journals
which are free to the user, or very low cost. Your university library has likely
cut the number of journals it offers because it can not afford the
astronomical prices of journals offered by large publishers such as Elsevier/Taylor-Francis.

One of the oldest electronic journals, founded in 1994 by Herbert S. Wilf
and Neil Calkin, is
[The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics](https://www.combinatorics.org/).
Since then
there have been others including:
Enumerative Combinatorics and Applications,
Algebraic Combinatorics,
Advances in Combinatorics,
Discrete Analysis,
Ars Inveniendi Analytica.
I am surprised that the list of Open Access, arXiv overlay journals is so
small and that commercial publishers abound. There are many commercial
journals (as opposed to society journals) with very low academic standards
and fewer with high academic standards which are very expensive and
lock up mathematical research via expensive paywalls and, at times,
lengthy copyright agreements.

If you do not know about the many benefits, and few challenges, associated
with Open Access publishing, then you may be interested in
[Open Access Directory](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page).

For an informative (if lengthy) historical account of background to
this area, see the [letter](files/joalet.pdf) from Donald E. Knuth to fellow members
of the Journal of Algorithms editorial board outlining the problem, describing
the open-access solution.

A list of journals whose editorial boards have resigned can be found
[here](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Journal_declarations_of_independence).

So my questions are: Why are there so few Open Access journals? and
Why do ruthless commercial publishers like Elsevier/Springer have such a
strong hold on academic publishing (in mathematics).

Of course academics trade in reputation/status, and if commercial journals
are perceived to have higher status than society journals (because they cost
much more, for example), then there will be some academics who will wish to
submit to, referee for, and act as editors for, commercial journals even if it is to the long-term detriment of mathematics.
In a separate blog I will consider best practice academic publishing: how are
errors/updates handled? when non-trivial computer programs form part of a proof
is computer code stored? is mathematical research immediately available?
Can mathematics flourish with 5, 10, 20 year copyright agreements? etc

<h2> How should we handle errors?</h2>

It is no surprise that there are many more mathematical papers published now
than previously. Data from the International Association of Scientific,
Technical and Medical Publishers (STM) from 1968-2018 can be seen
[here](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/126980/global-number-of-publications-over-time). They show a threefold increase from 1980 to 2012 and a
five-sixfold increase from 1975 to 2018. It is reasonable to assume that the
number of mathematical errors have increased proportionally, or maybe at a
greater rate as the number of publications per mathematician grows.

Not all mistakes are equal. The simplest mistake is a typo, and this is
can commonly be detected and corrected, but occasionally the typo occurs in
a complex mathematical expression and correction is not straightforward.
Sometimes authors give incomplete arguments and while the reader may believe
the claimed result, the proof might be lacking. Of course there are examples
also of results/statements that are just plain wrong.
Over the last century many databases of groups have been published
(*p*-groups, simple groups, primitive groups, groups of ``small'' order). Almost all had errors of omission, of duplication, or incorrect entries commonly due to typos. How reliable are current databases? 
Mathematics builds
on itself it a way that is unique in the sciences, and authors commonly
trust the correctness of the published literature,
so it is conceivable that if mistakes proliferate that in hundred years
Mathematics could face a crisis of reliability.

Mathematics has undergone crises in the past, for example the foundational
problems in set theory and
[problems of rigor in algebraic geometry](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19420/what-mistakes-did-the-italian-algebraic-geometers-actually-make). It is possible that future mathematics may
inadvertently build large bodies of knowledge based on some erroneous results.

You may be aware of [Crossmark](https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/)
which says: *Research doesn’t stand still: even after publication, articles can be updated with supplementary data or corrections. It’s important to know if the content being cited has been updated, corrected, or retracted - and that’s the assurance that publishers can offer readers by using Crossmark. It’s a standardized button, consistent across platforms, revealing the status of an item of content, and can display any additional metadata the member chooses. Crucially, the Crossmark button can also be embedded in PDFs, which means that members have a way of alerting readers to changes months or even years after it’s been downloaded.*
