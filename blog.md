<h2> Academic publishing</h2>

Many academic libraries have changed substantially over the last decades with
the emphasis changing from physical to digital resources. The reasons for the
changes are many including pressures from readers, libraries, and
publishing companies.

Digital books and journals are cheap to distribute, store, share with other
libraries, easy to search etc. One might expect that some of these changes would
reduce the cost of academic journals. In scientific field the opposite
has occurred [1].XXXXXXXX
