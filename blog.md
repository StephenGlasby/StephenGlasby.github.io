<h2> Academic publishing</h2>

Mathematicians are good at seeing how to solve problems, but how good
are they at implementing the solutions?

In 2012 Tim Gowers wrote a blog that went viral
https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/elsevier-my-part-in-its-downfall/
He described how mathematics was being negatively impacted by Elsevier and
it did not need to be. Mathematicians can set up high quality journals
which are free to the user or very low cost. Your university library has likely
cut the number of journals it offers because it can not afford the
astronomical prices of journals offered by large publishers such as Elsevier.

One of the oldest electronic journals, founded in 1994 by Herbert S. Wilf
and Neil Calkin, was The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. Since then
there have been others including:
Enumerative Combinatorics and Applications,
Algebraic Combinatorics,
Advances in Combinatorics,
Discrete Analysis.
I am surprised that the list of Open Access, arXiv overlay journals is so
small and that commercial publishers abound. There are many commercial
journals (as opposed to society journals) with very low academic standards
and fewer with high academic standards which are very expensive and
lock up mathematical research via expensive paywalls and, at times,
lengthy copyright agreements.

If you do not know about the many benefits, and few challenges, associated
with Open Access publishing, then you may be interested in

For an informative (if lengthy) historical account of background to
this area, see the [letter](joalet.pdf) from Donald E. Knuth to fellow members
of the Journal of Algorithms editorial board outlining the problem, describing
the open-access solution.

A list of journals whose editorial boards have resigned can be found at

So my question is why are there so few Open Access journals?
and why do ruthless commercial publishers like Elsevier/Springer have such a
strong hold on academic publishing (in mathematics).

Of course academics trade in reputation/status, and if commercial journals
are percieved to have higher status than society journals (because they cost
much more, for example), then there will be some academics who will wish to
submit to, referee for, and act as editors for, commercial journals.
In a seperate blog I will consider best practice academic publishing: how are
errors/updates handled? when non-trivial computer programs form part of a proof
is computer code stored? is mathematical research immediately available?
can one search long papers for key information? etc
