Home page of Stephen Glasby

Stephen Glasby is Research Fellow at the University of Western Australia.
He began his research in computational group theory developing algorithms for
solvable groups (building on ideas by Kantor) but then broadened
to the matrix recognition project.
Stephen first developed algorithms (with his coauthors Howlett, O'Brien,
Leedham-Green) but did not
analyze their complexity: for example writing representations over
smaller fields (or writing projective representations modulo scalars over
a smaller field). Now he works to develop algorithms that have a
rigorous complexity analysis. Recent such work involves the recognition of
classical simple groups (joint with Praeger and Niemeyer). This required
us to solve an interesting problem in "probabilistic geometry": given
a nondegenerate symplectic, unitary, or orthogonal space V and nondegenerate
proper subspaces U and U', what is the probability that the subspace
U+U' is nondegenerate and has dimension dim(U) + dim(U')?

Stephen has published a series of papers that bound the number of composition
factors of various groups in terms of various parameters. In a joint paper
with Praeger, Rosa and Verret he proved that the number c(G) of composition
factors of a primitive permutation group of degree n is at
most (8/3)log_2(n) - 4/3 and that this bound is attained infinitely often.
