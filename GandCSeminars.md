**Title:** Normalizers of simple diagonal groups in polynomial time</br>
**Abstract:** The *normalizer problem* has as input generating sets $X$ and $Y$ for subgroups $G$ and $H$ of the symmetric group $S_n$, and asks one to return generators for the normalizer of $H$ in $G$.</br>
</br>
In my PhD thesis I developed algorithms for the situation where $G$ is the symmetric group $S_n$ and $H$ is primitive with non-regular socle. These algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type. I will also present the main tool I use to structure both theory and algorithms: permutation morphisms, a generalization of permutation isomorphisms.

|**Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Recognizing simple groups: alternating and classical<br />**Time and place:** 26 Feb 2021, 4pm at Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The structure of a non-solvable finite group is strongly influenced by its non-abelian composition factors.  A central problem in computational group theory, therefore, involves quickly recognizing non-abelian simple composition factors. I will consider the most commonly occurring non-abelian simple groups namely the alternating (Alt_n) or the classical groups (PSL_d(q), PSp_d(q), PSU_d(q), POmega_d(q)).  The idea is to find by random selection group elements with certain properties including being relatively abundant. This is joint work with Niemeyer, Praeger and Unger.|
|**Speaker:** Alice Niemeyer (RWTH Aachen University)<br />**Title:** Recognising Classical Groups <br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 03 Mar 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Algorithms to facilitate efficient computation with finite groups are a rich source of interesting problems. In this talk we discuss some of the problems that arise when designing an algorithm to find computationally useful generating sets for finite classical groups.|
|**Speaker:** Jack Saunders<br />**Title:** Cohomology of PSL(2,q)<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 26 Mar 2021, Zoom + Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:** Group cohomology is intricately tied to the extension theory of finite groups and their representations. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the area along with a generalisation of a result of Guralnick and Tiep from 2011. We will then discuss the cohomology of PSL(2, q) in cross (non-defining) characteristic, along with that of PGL(2, q) and SL(2, q) if time permits.|
|**Speaker:** Cheryl Praeger (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Finite edge-transitive Cayley graphs, quotient graphs and Frattini groups<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 09 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The edge-transitivity of a Cayley graph is most easily recognisable if the subgroup of `affine maps' preserving the graph structure is itself edge-transitive. These are the so-called normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs.  Each of them determines a set of quotients which are themselves normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs, and which are built from a very restricted family of groups (direct products of simple groups). We address the questions: how much information about the original Cayley graph can we retrieve from this special set of quotients? Can we ever reconstruct the original Cayley graph from them: if so, then how?  Our answers to these questions involve a type of `relative Frattini subgroup' determined by the Cayley graph, which has similar properties to the Frattini subgroup of a finite group. I'll discuss this and give some examples. It raises many new questions about Cayley graphs.  This is joint work with Behnam Khosravi.|

|**Speaker:** Binzhou Xia (The University of Melbourne)<br />**Title:** Constructing tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 16 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Half-arc-transitive graphs are a fascinating topic, which connects graph theory, Riemann surfaces and group theory. Although fruitful results have been obtained over the last half a century, it is still challenging to construct half-arc-transitive graphs with prescribed vertex stabilizers. In this talk, I'll focus on the tetravalent case, giving new constructions of half-arc-transitive graphs with various vertex stabilizers. This sheds light on the larger problem of which groups can be the vertex stabilizer of a tetravalent half-arc-transitive graph.|

|**Speaker:** Cheryl Praeger (University of Western Australia)<br />            **Title:** Finite edge-transitive Cayley graphs, quotient graphs and Frattini groups<br />                                                                      **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 23 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />             **Abstract:**  The edge-transitivity of a Cayley graph is most easily recognisable if the subgroup of `affine maps' preserving the graph structure is itself edge-transitive.

|**Speaker:** Marston Conder (The University of Auckland)<br />                 **Title:** Regular and chiral maps with given valency or given type<br />       **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 30 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />             **Abstract:**  A map is 2-cell embedding of a connected graph in a closed surface, breaking up the surface to simply-connected regions called faces. The map is called `regular' if its automorphism group has a single orbit on flags (which are like incident vertex-edge-face triples), or `orientably-regular' if the surface is orientable and the automorphism group of the map has a single orbit on arcs (incident vertex-edge pairs). If a map of the latter kind admits no reflections (e.g. fixing an arc but swapping the two faces incident with it), then the map is called `chiral'. In all such maps with a high degree of symmetry, all vertices have the same valency, say $k$, and all faces have the same size, say $m$, and then we call the ordered pair $\{m,k\}$ the `type' of the map. Writing a section of a forthcoming book on such maps (with Gareth Jones, Jozef Siran and Tom Tucker) has prompted me to review and extend what is known about regular and chiral maps with given valency $k$, or with given type $\{m,k\}$, including what happens in the special case where the automorphism group is isomorphic to an alternating or symmetric group. I will summarise some findings in this talk.|

|**Speaker:** Jeroen Schillewaert (The University of Auckland)<br />            **Title:** Constructing highly regular expanders from hyperbolic Coxeter groups <br />                                                                          **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 07 May 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />             **Abstract:**  Given a string Coxeter system (W,S), we construct highly regular quotients of the 1-skeleton of its universal polytope P, which form an infinite family of expander graphs when (W,S) is indefinite and P has finite vertex links. The regularity of the graphs in this family depends on the Coxeter diagram of (W,S). The expansion stems from superapproximation applied to (W,S). This construction is also extended to cover Wythoffian polytopes. As a direct application, we obtain several notable families of expander graphs with high levels of regularity, answering, in particular, the question posed by Chapman, Linial, and Peled positively.|

|**Speaker:** Michael Giudici (University of Western Australia)<br />           **Title:** Automorphism orbits of groups and the Monster<br />                  **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 14 may 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />             **Abstract:** The order of an element of a group is a natural invariant of an automorphism. In 1992, Zhang characterised all finite groups such that for all integers $k$ the automorphism group acts transitively on the set of all elements of order $k$. Such groups are called AT-groups. In this talk, I will discuss recent joint work with Alexander Bors and Cheryl Praeger that investigates two measures of how close a group is to being an AT-group. This includes a new interesting characterisation of the Monster simple group.|

|**Speaker:** Geoffrey Pearce (Perth Modern School)<br />                       **Title:** Modular origami and the transitive actions of S_4 and A_5<br />      **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 21 May 2021, Robert Street LT<br /><br />         **Abstract:**  Modular origami involves assembling individually folded paper 'modules' to build decorative 3-dimensional structures. Very often, these structures have the same rotational symmetry as either a cube or a dodecahedron, meaning that their rotation group is isomorphic to either S_4 or A_5. Many modular origami models 'showcase' a particular transitive action of one of these groups - either in the way different colours are used, or in the architecture of the model itself - and in some cases the models can even be interpreted as symmetrical incidence structures, such as partial linear spaces. In this seminar I'll discuss an assortment of origami models I've built over the past ten or so years, and describe the ways in which they illustrate various transitive actions and structures related to their rotation groups.|

|**Speaker:** Stephan Tornier (University of Newcastle)<br />                   **Title:** Groups acting on trees from finite combinatorial data<br />          **Time and place:** 4pm Fri 30 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />             **Abstract:**  In the broader theory of locally compact groups, groups acting on trees play a particularly important role. The 'global' structure of such groups is deeply connected to their 'local' actions on the tree. This is illustrated with two types of examples, both of which can be classified in terms of finite combinatorial data: locally transitive groups that contain an involutive edge inversion and satisfy one of several independence properties (T.), and groups that act with Tits' independence property (Reid-Smith). The classification is in terms of certain finite permutation groups and decorated graphs respectively and therefore lends itself to computations. I will outline the capabilities of a recently developed GAP package that provides methods in this direction (Hannouch-T.). Time permitting, I will also outline a strategy to classify closed, vertex-transitive groups acting on trees by combining methods used in the two classifications above.|

These algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type.
