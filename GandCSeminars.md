The Centre organises a number of open seminars, public lectures, and events.<br /><br />
​
The Groups and Combinatorics Seminar occurs regularly on Friday afternoons at 16:00. There will be `cake' in the Mathematics and Statistics tea room at 15:40 beforehand, and after 17:05 we go to the University Club for a drink. Everyone is welcome to join us. Please email the seminar convener <Stephen.Glasby@uwa.edu.au> if you would like to give a seminar.

|**Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Recognizing simple groups: alternating and classical<br />**Time and place:** 26 Feb 2021, 4pm at Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The structure of a non-solvable finite group is strongly influenced by its non-abelian composition factors.  A central problem in computational group theory, therefore, involves quickly recognizing non-abelian simple composition factors. I will consider the most commonly occurring non-abelian simple groups namely the alternating (Alt_n) or the classical groups (PSL_d(q), PSp_d(q), PSU_d(q), POmega_d(q)).  The idea is to find by random selection group elements with certain properties including being relatively abundant. This is joint work with Niemeyer, Praeger and Unger.|

|**Speaker:** Alice Niemeyer (RWTH Aachen University)<br />**Title:** Recognising Classical Groups <br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 03 Mar 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Algorithms to facilitate efficient computation with finite groups are a rich source of interesting problems. In this talk we discuss some of the problems that arise when designing an algorithm to find computationally useful generating sets for finite classical groups.|

|**Speaker:** Jack Saunders<br />**Title:** Cohomology of PSL(2,q)<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 26 Mar 2021, Zoom + Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:** Group cohomology is intricately tied to the extension theory of finite groups and their representations. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the area along with a generalisation of a result of Guralnick and Tiep from 2011. We will then discuss the cohomology of PSL(2, q) in cross (non-defining) characteristic, along with that of PGL(2, q) and SL(2, q) if time permits.|

|**Speaker:** Cheryl Praeger (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Finite edge-transitive Cayley graphs, quotient graphs and Frattini groups<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 09 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The edge-transitivity of a Cayley graph is most easily recognisable if the subgroup of "affine maps" preserving the graph structure is itself edge-transitive. These are the so-called normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs.  Each of them determines a set of quotients which are themselves normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs, and which are built from a very restricted family of groups (direct products of simple groups). We address the questions: how much information about the original Cayley graph can we retrieve from this special set of quotients? Can we ever reconstruct the original Cayley graph from them: if so, then how?  Our answers to these questions involve a type of "relative Frattini subgroup" determined by the Cayley graph, which has similar properties to the Frattini subgroup of a finite group. I'll discuss this and give some examples. It raises many new questions about Cayley graphs.  This is joint work with Behnam Khosravi.|

|**Speaker:** Binzhou Xia (The University of Melbourne)<br />**Title:** Constructing tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 16 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Half-arc-transitive graphs are a fascinating topic, which connects graph theory, Riemann surfaces and group theory. Although fruitful results have been obtained over the last half a century, it is still challenging to construct half-arc-transitive graphs with prescribed vertex stabilizers. In this talk, I'll focus on the tetravalent case, giving new constructions of half-arc-transitive graphs with various vertex stabilizers. This sheds light on the larger problem of which groups can be the vertex stabilizer of a tetravalent half-arc-transitive graph.|

|**Date:** 30 July 2021<br>                                                     **Speaker:** Sergio Sicchia (TU Kaiserslautern)<br>                             **Location:** Weatherburn Street LT<br>                                         **Title:** Normalizers of simple diagonal groups in polynomial time<br>         **Abstract:** The *normalizer problem* has as input generating sets X and Y for subgroups G and H of the symmetric group S_n, and asks one to return generators for the normalizer of H in G.<br><br>                                          In my PhD thesis I developed algorithms for the situation where G is the symmetric group S_n and H is primitive with non-regular socle. These algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type. I will also present the main tool I use to structure both theory and algorithms: permutation morphisms, a generalization of permutation isomorphisms.|


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 06 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Jesse Lansdown (University of Western Australia)<br>               **Title:** The existence of synchronising groups of diagonal type<br>           **Abstract:** Motivated originally by synchronisation in automata, there is ongoing work to classify primitive permutation groups within the sychronisation hierarchy. This hierarchy consists of natural classes of groups - synchronising, separating, and spreading - which lie between primitive and 2-transitive. Synchronising primitive groups must be of affine, almost simple, or diagonal type. Until recently, no synchronising groups of diagonal type were known. In this talk I will present recent work (with John Bamberg, Michael Giudici, and Gordon Royle) in which we show that PSL(2, q) × PSL(2, q) acting in its diagonal action on PSL(2,q) is separating, and hence synchronising, for q = 13 and q = 17, and non-spreading for all prime powers of q.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 13 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                  **Speaker:** Kurt Williams (University of Western Australia)<br>               **Title:** Rayleigh-Taylor instability: an application of group theory methods<br>           **Abstract:** The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is a ubiquitous phenomenon of significant interest to both physics and mathematics, occurring whenever two fluids of differing densities are accelerated against the density gradient. The problem is ill-posed, but by careful appeal to the theory of space-groups, a solution can be constructed in full consistency with physics principles. We apply the theory of space groups to resolve the development of structures – both bubbles and spikes – along the interface. By constructing a velocity potential invariant under action of the relevant group, the interface conditions can be reduced to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which we solve in the early time “linear” regime and the later time “nonlinear” regime. We construct a geometry-independent form of the nonlinear dynamics including the structure velocity and the interfacial shear. The redimensionalisation transformations are used to compare the relative velocity and shear of both bubble and spike structures and compare the effect of dimensionality and symmetry on Rayleigh-Taylor instability.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 20 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Phill Schulz (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:**  The automorphism group of an abelian p-group<br>                    **Abstract:**  This is an expository talk about the structure of Aut(G) for an abelian p-group G.  I present a sequence of increasingly complex examples: cyclic, finite, bounded, direct sum of cyclics, simply presented, leading to the open general case. No previous knowledge of abelian group theory is required.|
