<h2> 2022 Seminars</h2>

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 25 March 2022, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Tony Li (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:**  The chromatic polynomial of a graph and its roots<br><br> |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 01 April 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Michael Giudici (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:**  $2$-closed groups and automorphism groups of digraphs<br><br>                    **Abstract:** Wielandt introduced the notion of the 2-closure of a permutation group $G$ on a set $\Omega$. This is the largest subgroup of $\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ with the same set of orbits on ordered pairs as $G$. We say that $G$ is 2-closed if $G$ is equal to its 2-closure. The automorphism group of a graph or digraph is a 2-closed group. In this talk I will discuss some recent work with Luke Morgan and Jin-Xin Zhou on 2-closed groups that are not the automorphism group of a graph or digraph.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 22 April 2021, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Heiko Dietrich (Monash University)<br>                 **Title:**  Computing with groups<br><br>                    **Abstract:** Many groups (and other algebraic structures) can be described concisely by small generating sets, which makes them suitable for machine computations. My talk will report on some common ways to describe groups for a computer and how to compute them, and then focus on a survey of known and new quotient algorithms.|

The Maths and Stastistics Coloquium on *Thursday 28 April* will be by Heiko Dietrich.

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Thu 28 April 2022, Blakers LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Heiko Dietrich (Monash University)<br>                 **Title:**  Deciding that two groups are the same: an update on group isomorphism<br><br>                    **Abstract:** Groups are mathematical objects that abstractly capture the concept of symmetry. Two groups are isomorphic if they essentially describe the same data, but they might be given with respect to different frameworks of reference. More specifically, two groups are isomorphic if there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between their elements that preserves the group operations. The group isomorphism problem is a decision problem that asks whether two given groups are isomorphic. This problem is of interest in theoretical computer science (with focus on the complexity of the problem) and in computational group theory (with focus on practical algorithms). My talk will survey some known results and comment on some recent new results, covering both complexity theory and practical applications to computer algebra systems. |


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 06 May 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Pablo Spiga (Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca)<br>                 **Title:** Erdős-Ko-Rado theorems for permutation groups <br><br>                    **Abstract:**  The Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem is a classical result in extremal set theory which has remarkable generalizations in various areas of mathematics.  In this talk, we are interested in a generalization of the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem for permutation groups. In this talk, we review some of the early results of Erdős on intersecting sets of permutations and some recent developments. |


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 20 May 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Andrea Lucchini (University of Padova)<br>                 **Title:**  The soluble graph and the Engel graph of a finite group<br><br>                    **Abstract:**  In the commuting graph of a finite group G there is an edge between two vertices x and y if  <x,y>  is abelian. We may generalize this definition in two different directions. Given a class F of finite groups, the F-graph of G is the undirected graph in which there is an edge between x and y if <x,y> is in F. Given a word w in the free group of rank 2, the w-graph of G is the direct graph in which there is an edge x->y  if w(x,y)=1. In the first part of the talk we will discuss the connectivity properties of the F-graphs, with particular attention to the case when  F is the class of the finite soluble groups, describing some results obtained in a joint paper with Tim Burness and Daniele Nemmi. In the second part of the talk we will consider the n-Engel graph, i.e. the w-graph where w is the n-Engel word and we will define the Engel graph of G as the graph whose vertices are the elements of G which does not belong to the hypercenter of G, and in which there is an edge x->y if the n-Engel word is trivial in x and y, for some positive integer n. In a joint paper with Eloisa Detomi and Daniele Nammi, we proved that if G modulo the hypercenter is neither an almost simple group nor a Frobenius group, then the Engel graph of G is strongly connected. The connectivity properties of the Engel graphs of the almost simple groups are investigated in a very recent joint work with Pablo Spiga.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 27 May 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Gordon Royle (University of Western Australia)<br>       **Title:** Computational Combinatorics, Binary Matroids and Cubelike Graphs (cancelled)<br><br>                    **Abstract:** In 1976, Appel and Haken announced a proof of the 4-colour theorem that fundamentally relied on extensive computer calculations that could never be verified by hand. Despite the vehement negative reactions to this announcement by various prominent mathematicians and philosophers and their dire warnings about the death of proof, mathematics has somehow survived its predicted collapse. Combinatorics in particular has not only survived, but has grown enormously over the last 50 years, not *despite* the use of the computers, but at least partly *because* of the use of computers. <br><br> Computational combinatorics is an umbrella term describing a style of research that involves “combining pure mathematics, algorithms and computational resources to solve problems in pure combinatorics”. This broad term encompasses many computational tasks, including direct search for examples or counterexamples, construction of databases of combinatorial objects, experimenting with small cases to develop or fine-tune conjectures consistent with the data, and so on. <br><br>Almost all of my own research could be described as computational combinatorics, but often the final papers downplay (or even omit) details of the computations that were instrumental in finding the results. In this talk, I will describe some of the computational techniques, tools and software that I have used,  focusing on my research into binary matroids and cubelike graphs as illustrative examples throughout.  <br><br>No specific prior knowledge of binary matroids or cubelike graphs is needed to follow the talk, because it turns out that both binary matroids and cubelike graphs are essentially just sets of vectors in a binary vector space, just viewed from different perspectives  (which will be fully explained).<br><br> I will be giving this talk at the AMSI Workshop “Bridging Mathematics and Computer Science” in Sydney the following week, so constructive criticism is welcomed. |


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 03 June 2022, Robert Street LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br>       **Title:** Derangements in wreath products <br><br>                    **Abstract:** A derangement is a permutation with no fixed points. Much research has gone into studying the proportion of derangements in a finite permutation group G. This talk was motivated by the question: What can we say about the proportion of derangements in a large primitive permutation group? Such a group preserves a cartesian power structure and its socle is a power of an alternating group. I will make several connections with past research and some classical combinatorics. This is joint work with V. Arumugam and H. Dietrich.  |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 1 July 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Alice Devillers (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:** J-groups <br><br>                    **Abstract:**  At the 2018 CMSC retreat, Tim Boykett introduced a peculiar group condition in the form of a functional equation:  <br><br> We say a group G is a J-group if there exists an element k (called witness) and a function f from G to G  such that f(xk)=xf(x) for all x in G.  <br><br>I will explain what we found out about this property and the set of witnesses, as well as the twists and turns that led from the retreat to the publication of our results in 2022.  <br><br> In particular, we will be interested in the question of which p-groups are J-groups.   <br><br> This is joint work with Dominik Bernhardt, Tim Boykett,  Johannes Flake, Stephen Glasby. |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 15 July 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Jesse Lansdown (University of Western Australia)<br>        **Title:**  Small Schurian association schemes<br><br>                    **Abstract:** Association schemes describe highly regular combinatorial structures and are important in coding theory, geometry, group theory, and even statistics. An association scheme arising from a transitive group is called Schurian. With the recent classification of transitive permutation groups of degree 48 by Holt, Royle, and Tracey, we are able to classify the Schurian association schemes of order at most 48 and consequently the 2-closed transitive permutation groups of corresponding degree. In this seminar I will present details of the computational aspects of this classification, as well as an overview of some of the properties of the resulting association schemes. |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 22 July 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Lie Chen (University of Western Australia)<br>        **Title:** The maximal subgroups of the finite symplectic groups <br><br>                    **Abstract:** The research of the maximal subgroups of the finite classical groups is intimately connected to the study of the primitive permutation groups. In 1984, Aschbacher developed a fundamental theorem that roughly depicts the subgroups of almost all of the finite almost simple classical groups, which divides these subgroups into nine classes. The result was then enriched by Kleidman and Liebeck in 1989. They provided remarkably detailed enumeration of the maximal subgroups of geometric type of the almost simple finite classical groups of dimension greater than 12. In this talk I will discuss Aschbacher’s theorem in the finite symplectic groups. |



|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 12 Aug 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Anton Baykalov (University of Western Australia)<br>        **Title:** Intersection of conjugate solvable subgroups in finite groups <br><br>                    **Abstract:**  Consider the following problem stated by Vdovin (2010) in the “Kourovka notebook” (Problem 17.41):   <br><br> Let $H$ be a solvable subgroup of a finite group $G$ that has no nontrivial solvable normal subgroups. Do there always exist five conjugates of $H$ whose intersection is trivial?   <br><br> This problem is closely related to a conjecture by Babai, Goodman and Pyber (1997) about an upper bound for the index of a normal solvable subgroup in a finite group. The problem was reduced by Vdovin (2012) to the case when $G$ is an almost simple group. In this talk, we discuss the latest progress on the problem.|


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 19 Aug 2022, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Cheryl E. Praeger (University of Western Australia)<br>       **Title:**  The pleasure of working with Jan Saxl<br><br>                    **Abstract:**  Jan Saxl was Professor of Algebra at Cambridge, and a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, until his death in 2020. <br><br> Jan and I were exact contemporaries as DPhil students of Peter Neumann in Oxford. Our first research collaboration began six years later, a year before the finite simple  group classification (FSGC) was announced. My talk will reflect on our research collaborations, often also with Martin Liebeck. A major theme was application of the FSGC on problems involving permutation groups, graph symmetry, and simple group structure.  I wrote this talk to give at the Jan Saxl Memorial Day which Martin Liebeck and I organised in Cambridge on July 23.  |

<h2> Upcoming 2022 Seminars (details may change)</h2>

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 26 Aug 2022, Weatherburn LT, MS Teams<br>                 **Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br>       **Title:**  The proportion of non-degenerate complementary subspaces in classical spaces. <br><br>                    **Abstract:**  Recognising classical groups is a key problem in computational group theory. This talk shows how a powerful technique in algebraic graph theory, the expander mixing lemma, can be used to solve a geometric problem needed for classical recognition. The problem is to find a lower bound for the proportion of pairs of complementary non-degenerate subspaces of prescribed dimensions. Once the eigenvalues are known, the computation is straightforward. This is joint work with Ferdinand Ihringer and Sam Mattheus. |

<h2> 2021 Seminars</h2>

|**Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Recognizing simple groups: alternating and classical<br />**Time and place:** 26 Feb 2021, 4pm at Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The structure of a non-solvable finite group is strongly influenced by its non-abelian composition factors.  A central problem in computational group theory, therefore, involves quickly recognizing non-abelian simple composition factors. I will consider the most commonly occurring non-abelian simple groups namely the alternating (Alt_n) or the classical groups (PSL_d(q), PSp_d(q), PSU_d(q), POmega_d(q)).  The idea is to find by random selection group elements with certain properties including being relatively abundant. This is joint work with Niemeyer, Praeger and Unger.|

|**Speaker:** Alice Niemeyer (RWTH Aachen University)<br />**Title:** Recognising Classical Groups <br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 03 Mar 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Algorithms to facilitate efficient computation with finite groups are a rich source of interesting problems. In this talk we discuss some of the problems that arise when designing an algorithm to find computationally useful generating sets for finite classical groups.|

|**Speaker:** Jack Saunders<br />**Title:** Cohomology of PSL(2,q)<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 26 Mar 2021, Zoom + Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:** Group cohomology is intricately tied to the extension theory of finite groups and their representations. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the area along with a generalisation of a result of Guralnick and Tiep from 2011. We will then discuss the cohomology of PSL(2, q) in cross (non-defining) characteristic, along with that of PGL(2, q) and SL(2, q) if time permits.|

|**Speaker:** Cheryl Praeger (University of Western Australia)<br />**Title:** Finite edge-transitive Cayley graphs, quotient graphs and Frattini groups<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 09 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  The edge-transitivity of a Cayley graph is most easily recognisable if the subgroup of "affine maps" preserving the graph structure is itself edge-transitive. These are the so-called normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs.  Each of them determines a set of quotients which are themselves normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs, and which are built from a very restricted family of groups (direct products of simple groups). We address the questions: how much information about the original Cayley graph can we retrieve from this special set of quotients? Can we ever reconstruct the original Cayley graph from them: if so, then how?  Our answers to these questions involve a type of "relative Frattini subgroup" determined by the Cayley graph, which has similar properties to the Frattini subgroup of a finite group. I'll discuss this and give some examples. It raises many new questions about Cayley graphs.  This is joint work with Behnam Khosravi.|

|**Speaker:** Binzhou Xia (The University of Melbourne)<br />**Title:** Constructing tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs<br />**Time and place:** 4pm Fri 16 Apr 2021, Weatherburn LT<br /><br />**Abstract:**  Half-arc-transitive graphs are a fascinating topic, which connects graph theory, Riemann surfaces and group theory. Although fruitful results have been obtained over the last half a century, it is still challenging to construct half-arc-transitive graphs with prescribed vertex stabilizers. In this talk, I'll focus on the tetravalent case, giving new constructions of half-arc-transitive graphs with various vertex stabilizers. This sheds light on the larger problem of which groups can be the vertex stabilizer of a tetravalent half-arc-transitive graph.|

|**Date:** 30 July 2021<br>                                                     **Speaker:** Sergio Sicchia (TU Kaiserslautern)<br>                             **Location:** Weatherburn Street LT<br>                                         **Title:** Normalizers of simple diagonal groups in polynomial time<br>         **Abstract:** The *normalizer problem* has as input generating sets X and Y for subgroups G and H of the symmetric group S_n, and asks one to return generators for the normalizer of H in G.<br><br>                                          In my PhD thesis I developed algorithms for the situation where G is the symmetric group S_n and H is primitive with non-regular socle. These algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type. I will also present the main tool I use to structure both theory and algorithms: permutation morphisms, a generalization of permutation isomorphisms.|


|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 06 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Jesse Lansdown (University of Western Australia)<br>               **Title:** The existence of synchronising groups of diagonal type<br>           **Abstract:** Motivated originally by synchronisation in automata, there is ongoing work to classify primitive permutation groups within the sychronisation hierarchy. This hierarchy consists of natural classes of groups - synchronising, separating, and spreading - which lie between primitive and 2-transitive. Synchronising primitive groups must be of affine, almost simple, or diagonal type. Until recently, no synchronising groups of diagonal type were known. In this talk I will present recent work (with John Bamberg, Michael Giudici, and Gordon Royle) in which we show that PSL(2, q) × PSL(2, q) acting in its diagonal action on PSL(2,q) is separating, and hence synchronising, for q = 13 and q = 17, and non-spreading for all prime powers of q.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 13 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                  **Speaker:** Kurt Williams (University of Western Australia)<br>               **Title:** Rayleigh-Taylor instability: an application of group theory methods<br><br>           **Abstract:** The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is a ubiquitous phenomenon of significant interest to both physics and mathematics, occurring whenever two fluids of differing densities are accelerated against the density gradient. The problem is ill-posed, but by careful appeal to the theory of space-groups, a solution can be constructed in full consistency with physics principles. We apply the theory of space groups to resolve the development of structures – both bubbles and spikes – along the interface. By constructing a velocity potential invariant under action of the relevant group, the interface conditions can be reduced to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which we solve in the early time “linear” regime and the later time “nonlinear” regime. We construct a geometry-independent form of the nonlinear dynamics including the structure velocity and the interfacial shear. The redimensionalisation transformations are used to compare the relative velocity and shear of both bubble and spike structures and compare the effect of dimensionality and symmetry on Rayleigh-Taylor instability.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 20 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Phill Schulz (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:**  The automorphism group of an abelian p-group<br><br>                    **Abstract:**  This is an expository talk about the structure of Aut(G) for an abelian p-group G.  I present a sequence of increasingly complex examples: cyclic, finite, bounded, direct sum of cyclics, simply presented, leading to the open general case. No previous knowledge of abelian group theory is required.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 27 August 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Ted Dobson (FAMNIT, University of Primorska)<br>                 **Title:** A new family of transitive permutation groups,and the solution to two problems on vertex-transitive graphs <br><br>             **Abstract:** Over the course of my career, I have noticed that many results on symmetries in graphs, especially concerning the Cayley isomorphism problem, determining automorphism groups of vertex-transitive graphs, and also determining minimal transitive subgroups of the automorphism groups of vertex-transitive graphs (essentially classifying them), do not need too much information about the graph being considered. That is, a certain group theoretic property that the automorphism group of a vertex-transitive graph has is all that is needed to prove many results. To capture this idea, we introduce a new class of transitive permutation groups which has this property, and contains all transitive 2-closed permutation groups. There are 3-closed groups which do not have this property, so in a way this class is “between” 2-closed and 3-closed. So we call this class 5/2-closed. It turns out that not only are 2-closed groups contained in this new class, but also the automorphism groups of configurations, and in more generality, combinatorial objects whose “edge” set is a 1-intersecting set system (that is, any two “edges” intersect in exactly one vertex).<br><br> To demonstrate this idea, we solve two problems in the more general context of 5/2-closed transitive group, and so obtain as corollaries the solutions to the two problems for 2-closed groups. Let p, q, and r, be distinct primes. We show that any 5/2-closed group with a normally (or genuinely) 3-step imprimitive subgroup has a minimal transitive subgroup in one of four families. It is known that for each of these four families, there is a vertex-transitive graph whose automorphism group contains a minimal transitive subgroup in the family but does not have a minimal transitive subgroup in the other three families. Next, we determine all 5/2-closed permutation groups of odd prime-power degree that contain a regular cyclic subgroup, and so also determine all 2-closed permutation groups of odd prime-power order that contain a regular cyclic subgroup.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 03 September 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Primož Potočnik (University of Ljubljana, Faculty of mathematics and physics)<br>                 **Title:** Fixity of vertex-transitive graphs <br><br>                    **Abstract:** Given a connected finite graph Gamma on n vertices, one can ask what is the maximum number of vertices that a nontrivial automorphism of Gamma can fix. This parameter will be called the {\em fixity} of the graph Gamma. The notion of {\em fixity} (or rather its ``opposite'' notion, the minimum number of points moved by an element of the group, called called {\em minimal degree}) has been studied extensively in the context of permutation groups. For example, a classical result of Jordan states that the symmetric group S_n is the only primitive permutation groups of degree $n$ and fixity n-2. On the other hand, not much is known about the graph theoretical version of the problem. Clearly the fixity of Gamma is maximal possible (that is, n-2) if and only if there exists two vertices that, after removing an edge between them if they are adjacent, have the same neighbourhood, and it is minimum possible (that is, 0), if the automorphism group acts semiregularly on the vertices. However, I will focus on the question what can be said about connected vertex-transitive graphs of small valence (3 and 4, in particular) whose fixity is large. In particular, I will present a solution of a problem that was raised a few years ago, asking for the classification of connected cubic vertex-transitive graphs with fixity larger than 1/3. This solution is a result of joint work with Pablo Spiga.|

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 17 September 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>              **Speaker:** Lie Chen (UWA in China)<br>                                        **Title:**  Vertex-primitive s-arc-transitive digraphs of almost simple groups<br><br>                                                                          **Abstract:** The property of s-arc-transitivity has been well studied for many years. Weiss proved that finite undirected graphs that are not cycles can be at most 7-arc-transitive. On the other hand, Praeger showed that for each s there are infinitely many finite s-arc-transitive digraphs that are not (s+1)-arc-transitive. However, G-vertex-primitive (G,s)-arc-transitive digraphs for large s seem rare. Thus we are interested in finding an upper bound for such s. In 2018, Giudici and Xia showed that it is sufficient to determine s when G is almost simple. We will show that s\leq 1 when G is almost simple  with socle Sz(2^{2n+1}) or ^{2}G_{2}(3^{2n+1}) for n\geq 1. |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 24 September 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Stephen Glasby (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:**  On the maximum of the weighted binomial sum $2^{-r}\sum_{i=0}^r\binom{m}{i}$<br><br>                    **Abstract:** Add the first r+1 binomial coefficients in the row m of Yang Hui's (aka Pascal's) triangle and divide by 2^r. This gives a function which appears in probability, coding theory, information theory, and even permutation group theory. For most values of r there is no closed formula for this sum. We prove that the maximum of this function occurs (with 4 exceptions) when r equals Floor(m/3)+1. The proof of this splits into two parts: one is easy and the other is quite difficult requiring an increasing amount of precision. The talk is not technical, and it mentions generalizations and open questions. This is joint with G.R. Paseman. |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 08 October 2021, Weatherburn LT<br>                 **Speaker:** Natalia Maslova (RAS and Krasovsky Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics)<br><br>                 **Title:** On characterization of a finite group by its Gruenberg-Kegel graph <br>                    **Abstract:** The Gruenberg-Kegel graph GK(G) associated with a finite group G is an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges whose vertices are the prime divisors of the order of G and in which vertices p and q are adjacent in GK(G) if and only if G contains an element of order pq. This graph has been the subject of much recent interest. In this talk we discuss a recent progress in characterization of a finite group by its Gruenberg-Kegel graph. |

|**Time and Place:** 4pm Fri 29 October 2021, Robert Street LT<br>                 **Speaker:** John Bamberg (University of Western Australia)<br>                 **Title:** On Shult and Thas' special sets <br><br>                    **Abstract:** Shult and Thas ("Constructions of polygons from buildings", Proc. LMS, 1995) showed that a certain configuration of totally singular lines of a nonsingular elliptic quadric in the finite projective space PG(5,q) gives rise to a generalised quadrangle of order (q^2,q^2). This geometric object can also be seen as a certain configuration of totally singular points of the Hermitian space H(3,q^2), and is often called a "special set" in the literature. The generalised quadrangle Q(4,q^2) arises this way, from the classical special set, and it is an open problem to find non-classical special sets. This talk is on joint work with Giusy Monzillo and Alessandro Siciliano, where we characterise special sets from an algebraic combinatorial point of view.  |

**Title:** Neighbour-transitive codes in generalised quadrangles <br><br>       **Abstract:**  A code C in an arbitrary graph \varGamma is a subset of the vertex set of \varGamma. The minimum distance \delta of a code C is the smallest distance between a pair of distinct elements of C and the graph metric gives rise to a partition {C_0,C_1,\ldots,C_\rho} of the vertices of \varGamma where C_0=C and \rho is the maximum distance between any vertex of \varGamma and its nearest element in C. In this talk we consider the case where \varGamma is the point-line incidence graph of a generalised quadrangle {\mathcal Q} and we say that C is a code in the generalised quadrangle {\mathcal Q}. Since the diameter of \varGamma is 4, both \rho and \delta are at most 4. If \delta=4 then C is a partial ovoid or partial spread of {\mathcal Q}, and if, additionally, \rho=2 then C is an ovoid or a spread. A code C in {\mathcal Q} is neighbour-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on each of the sets C and C_1. The talk includes some examples, some partial classification results and some open questions. |
