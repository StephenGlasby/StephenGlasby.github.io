Normalizers of simple diagonal groups in polynomial time|
The *normalizer problem* has as input generating sets X and Y for
subgroups G and H of the symmetric group S_n, and asks one to return
generators for the normalizer of H in G.
In my PhD thesis I developed algorithms for the situation where G is the
symmetric group S_n and H is primitive with non-regular socle. These
algorithms are both practically efficient and run in polynomial time. In
this talk I will focus on primitive groups of simple diagonal (SD) type.
I will also present the main tool I use to structure both theory and
algorithms: permutation morphisms, a generalization of permutation
isomorphisms.|
